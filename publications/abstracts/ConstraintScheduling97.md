 It is discussed, how scheduling problems can be solved in the
concurrent constraint programming language Oz. Oz is the first
high-level constraint language, which offers an interface to invent
new constraints in an efficient way using C++. Its multi-paradigm
features including programmable search are unique in the field of
constraint programming. Through the interface, algorithms from
Operations Research and related fields can be incorporated. The
algorithms can be combined through encapsulation into constraints and
can communicate via shared variables. This is exemplified by the
integration of new techniques based on edge-finding for job-shop and
multi-capacitated scheduling. The viability of Oz as a platform for
problem solving is also exemplified by a graphical scheduling
workbench. The performance for job-shop problems is comparable to
state-of-the-art scheduling tools.
