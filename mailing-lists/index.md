For Mozart discussion we provide the following mailing lists (Google Groups):

## [Users: Mozart Users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozart-users) 
[Mozart Users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozart-users) is for for general
discussion, ideas, and questions about how to use Mozart.

## [Language implementation: Mozart Hackers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozart-hackers)
[Mozart Hackers](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozart-hackers) is

They also provide a convenient online archive of past discussions.
