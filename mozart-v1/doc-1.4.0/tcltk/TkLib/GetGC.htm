<DL>
<P><DT>Tk_Window <B>tkwin</B> (in)<DD>
Token for window in which the graphics context will be used.
<P><DT>unsigned long <B>valueMask</B> (in)<DD>
Mask of bits (such as <B>GCForeground</B> or <B>GCStipple</B>)
indicating which fields of <I>*valuePtr</I> are valid.
<P><DT>XGCValues <B>*valuePtr</B> (in)<DD>
Pointer to structure describing the desired values for the
graphics context.
<P><DT>Display <B>*display</B> (in)<DD>
Display for which <I>gc</I> was allocated.
<P><DT>GC <B>gc</B> (in)<DD>
X identifier for graphics context that is no longer needed.
Must have been allocated by <B>Tk_GetGC</B>.

<H3><A NAME="M5">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>
<B>Tk_GetGC</B> and <B>Tk_FreeGC</B> manage a collection of graphics contexts
being used by an application.  The procedures allow graphics contexts to be
shared, thereby avoiding the server overhead that would be incurred
if a separate GC were created for each use.  <B>Tk_GetGC</B> takes arguments
describing the desired graphics context and returns an X identifier
for a GC that fits the description.  The graphics context that is returned
will have default values in all of the fields not specified explicitly
by <I>valueMask</I> and <I>valuePtr</I>.
<P>
<B>Tk_GetGC</B> maintains a
database of all the graphics contexts it has created.  Whenever possible,
a call to <B>Tk_GetGC</B> will
return an existing graphics context rather than creating a new one.  This
approach can substantially reduce server overhead, so <B>Tk_GetGC</B>
should generally be used in preference to the Xlib procedure
<B>XCreateGC</B>, which creates a new graphics context on each call.
<P>
Since the return values of <B>Tk_GetGC</B>
are shared, callers should never modify the graphics contexts
returned by <B>Tk_GetGC</B>.
If a graphics context must be modified dynamically, then it should be
created by calling <B>XCreateGC</B> instead of <B>Tk_GetGC</B>.
<P>
When a graphics context
is no longer needed, <B>Tk_FreeGC</B> should be called to release it.
There should be exactly one call to <B>Tk_FreeGC</B> for
each call to <B>Tk_GetGC</B>.
When a graphics context is no longer in use anywhere (i.e. it has
been freed as many times as it has been gotten) <B>Tk_FreeGC</B>
will release it to the X server and delete it from the database.
